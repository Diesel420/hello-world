# hello-world
my repository

Hello everyone,
Im new to coding, when i was younger i was familliar with javascript and html a little bit. Git hub and ether is all so new to me,i look forward to learning and meeting everyone/someone soon. thanks for all of the clues and perfect timing when it comes making me read or click on something that you know i should be readin or learning. I have recently had unexplainable events happen to me, and im verry excited to be apart of something bigger. I would gladly like to take some lessons, have a tutor, my funds have been limited latly. so you may not see much of me while i look for a job and try to get my debts settled. hope to hear from someone soon about change, i have many questions that need answering, and skills i need to learn to be good at what i have been appointed. thankyou all and god bless.
